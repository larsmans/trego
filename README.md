trego
=====

Go bindings for the [TRE](http://laurikari.net/tre) approximate string
matching library. Unfinished and highly experimental; patches are welcome.

To build, first make sure TRE is installed. For Debian/Ubuntu, that's

    sudo apt-get install libtre-dev

For Red Hat-like (e.g. CentOS)

    sudo yum install libtre-devel
